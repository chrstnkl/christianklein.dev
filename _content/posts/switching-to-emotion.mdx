In the last years [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) was my default choice when
it came to styling my components in React. It's one of the most popular CSS in JS libraries, used by many companies
around the web and in the top ranks of the
[The State Of CSS survey](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/technologies/css-in-js/). It is therefore even sadder to see
that the contributions to such a great project a declining. The last months there were fewer and fewer
[contributions and only one active maintainer](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/graphs/contributors)
with more than 200 open issues. I only became aware of this fact while investigating an issue I had on another project
where I also use [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) in combination with styled-components and
Material UI (it's about styles getting added in the wrong order. If you're interested you can read up more
[here](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro/issues/277)).

For another project this made me thinking if I should still stick to **styled-components**. It is still a great and
satisfying library and I'm familiar with it, know how to use it and it still is working reliably. But what happens if
more critical issues arise or it stops working in one of the next versions of React? So I decided to give
[emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) a try which is another CSS in JS library inspired by styled-components.
So the syntax is very similar to the one of styled-components and on top of that it has a smaller package size and has a
higher performance. So when migrating you almost can keep all of your styled components untouched. This made it _very_
easy to migrate also the code base of this page from styled-components to emotion. Since I'm using twin.macro I needed
to change the configuration a little bit (small adjustments in six files). So let's see how it is going with emotion!

This does not mean that I turn my back completely on styled-components. I still have it in use in other projects and
hope very much that more contributions will come soon!
