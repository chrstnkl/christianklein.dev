Building a web application in 2021 isn't that hard - at least if you have some experience in frontend development There
are so many tools, frameworks and libraries out in the wild that the real tricky thing is: what to use? I want to write
down some of the reasons why I chose the underlying tech stack for building this site.

## The framework

Since I'm developing with React for quite a while now, the question when I started thinking about building this site
wasn't React or no React. It was Next.js or Gatbsy. While Gatsby is used for creating static-pages with high
performance, Next.js is a powerful framework for static and server-rendered applications. I have both worked with
Next.js and Gatsby and both would be suitable for builing a site like this, you could even argue that Gatsby would be
the perfect fit. I don't need to fetch data from an external source, all posts are written in markdown (and even stored
in the repository) and there is no real need for server-rendered stuff, all pages could be static. But Next.js also
supports static site generation since version 9.3 and in general I have the impression that Next.js currently has a
higher momentum and feels more powerful than Gatsby, where I would be more limited. The benefit of Next.js is that you
can start with a minimal setup but it also can scale up easiliy at a later stage without rewriting your whole
application. Cool, right? And let's be honest, since the whole porpuse of building this site was to have fun building
and playing around with it, I chose Next.js. After all, it should also be my playground to try out things. ðŸ˜€

## The styling

Also I finally wanted to get some hands on work with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which is a utility-first
CSS framework. I was struggling with the decision to go for it because I'm also a huge fan of
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - a CSS-in-JS library which allows you to write your CSS alongside
your components in JavaScript. So chosing a utility-first framework in favor of a powerful CSS-in-JS library I have used
for several projects? I was a bit reluctant until I stumbled across
[twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro), which I read about in a post of the creator of
styled-components ([Why I Love Tailwind](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tailwind/)). Twin combines the capabilities of
Tailwind with the flexibility of CSS-in-JS and you can even combine it with libraries such as styled-components (but
also for example emotion).

After that it was settled! And to be honest, I wouldn't want to miss it. It really feels convinient to style your
components with TailwindCSS but still have the option to share your stylings or add conditional styles.

## The rest

Now the framework is set up and we can also style our pages but now we need to show some content (e.g. some articles
like this). but I also want to have some content (e.g. some articles I want to publish on my page) and some place to
store it. I decided to manage all the posts for this site using local markdown files. All posts are stored in the
`_content/posts/` directory enriched with some front-matter meta definitions. Maybe I write about this particular setup
in a dedicated post.

Of course it doesn't stop there. I also wanted to use TypeScript for type safety and ESLint for analysing my code and
enforcing coding conventions. For a small project this might be a bit much but I'm also using setups like this in other
projects. To quickly start a new project with a similar setup I created
[next-twin-starter](https://github.com/chrstnkl/next-twin-starter) which includes Next.js, TailwindCSS, twin.macro,
styled-components, TypeScript, ESLint and Prettier, all pre-configured for my needs. Feel free to take a look!

## Deploy

Finally we're done building our web application! But where to deploy it? If I would've used the static-site generation
functionality of Next.js (`next export`, you can read more about it
[here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export)) I could've hosted this site everywhere, even in a
S3 bucket. But since I didn't do that I need a server with Node.js support. Now there are also many alternatives, you
could host it on your own custom server (with Node.js, if you have one), you could go for AWS or Azure or host it on
Vercel or Netlify. Both Vercel and Netlify are quite similar and offer easy seamless deployment of your web application
on a free as you grow pricing model. The differences can be found more in the detail. The main advantage of Vercel is
that it's the same team that also built Next.js so they're hosting solution is perfectly aligned with Next.js. And you
can start right away with literally zero configuration, you just have to link your repository and off you go!

To sum it up, this is the tech stack that I used for builing [christianklein.dev](https://christianklein.dev/).

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
