In my previous post [Building a web application in 2021](/posts/building-a-web-application-in-2021) I already mentioned
that I started using Tailwind CSS for this project and I've also used it for another work related project since. In this
article I want to share my experiences and my assessment of it with you.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework and, released in November 2017 (alpha), has raised much attention and
momentum in the recent year. So it's only natural that I was really curious about it and wanted to try it out. But to be
honest, at first I was rather sceptical. Being around as a web developer for more than 15 years now, I can confidently
say that I know how to write CSS. And a framework like Tailwind brings it's very own style and schematics. So why should
I use `flex` instead of defining `display: flex;` in the class I assign to this element? Now here already comes one
benefit of Tailwind: you don't have to define a class and, more importantly, you don't have to think about how to name
this class, just in order to assign `display: flex` to this element. With Tailwind you just write `class="flex"` (or
`className="flex"` for React). Of course usually you need to apply more CSS attributes then just `display: flex`. I want
to position the element inside the container below each other, center them vertically, add some padding, a border and a
border radius. So with pure CSS this would look like this:

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1rem 1.25rem;
  border: 1px solid rgb(229, 231, 235);
  order-radius: 6px;
}
```

Easy, right? But how the heck would I write this with Tailwind? I imagined that I would spend quite some time
espesically in the beginning to figure out all of the utilities. Fortunatley, Tailwind also comes with it's very own
IntelliSense plugin for VS Code, so you only have to type `px-` and it provides you with all the available horizontal
padding utilities. This way you're able to get used to the utilities really fast and quickly can style your elements.

Finally, the example above written in Tailwind would look something like this.

```html
<div class="flex flex-col items-center px-4 py5 border border-gray-200 rounded-md">...</div>
```

Easy, right? Sure, you have to get used to the syntax but the more familiar you become with it, the faster and more
convinient it feels.

You also can customise and extend the predefined utilities via `tailwind.config.js`. In there you can specify your theme
and define your colours and fonts and also override or extend the variants or default theme. This way you can easily
change an existing breakpoint or define your own screen size variants. You also can extend it with plugins or write your
own to register new styles, like the official Typography plugin.

## Using Tailwind CSS and CSS-in-JS

So with all of this, Tailwind gives you the tools to quickly build and style your components. This brings me to
something that made me hesitate to use it: **styled-components**. The CSS-in-JS library is basically my default choice
when it comes to styling my components in React. It is one of the most popular CSS in JS libraries used by many
companies around the web and is in the top ranks of the
[The State Of CSS survey](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/technologies/css-in-js/). Unfortunately, there were fewer
and fewer contributions in the last months and only one active maintainer but hopefully that doesn't mean the end of
such a great project. It makes it super easy to write your CSS stylings for your components. So, switching to Tailwind
CSS means dropping styled-components, right? Luckily no because there is
[twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) to the rescue! It "blends the magic of Tailwind with the
flexibility of css-in-js at build time". What does this mean? It means that you can use Tailwind to style your
components but still extend it by writing your custom CSS with styled-components. And the great thing is that
_twin.macro_ uses Babel to pick up your Tailwind classes and converts them into CSS objects on build time which are
passed again in your chosen CSS-in-JS library (in my case styled-components). This way it doesn't add any size to your
build.

```js
import "twin.macro"

<div tw="flex flex-row md:flex-col" />

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

<div
  css={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "col";
    "@media (min-width: 768px)": {
      flexDirection: "row"
    }
  }}
/>
```

And a combination of _twin.macro_ and _styled-components_ would look like this:

```js
import "twin.macro"

<div tw="flex flex-row md:flex-col" css={{`background-image: url('hello-world.png')`}} />
```

With that there wasn't any reason to not use Tailwind! And it helped me a lot. One issue I had when I was using
**styled-components** only was that I too often made the mistake of writing too _many_ styled components. When I just
needed to add some padding to a component, I created a new styled component (something like `<PaddedComponent ...>`).
Now I just can write

```html
<div tw="p-2">Hello world</div>
```

and that's it (of course with styled-components I could have used the `css` prop but I rarely used it because it felt
easier to define a new component - it could have been that I had to define some more styling at some point...).

## Things to keep in mind

So using Tailwind brings many advantages. You're way faster, you don't have to think about class names (or styled
component names), it makes it easy to define a theme and there are many great plugins available! But of course when you
apply your Tailwind utility classes you should not make the mistake of applying the same classes for all of your
re-usable elements. When you think back to "vanilla" CSS, when you define a class to style one or multiple elements you
define it once but you can re-use this class whenever you need it (for example for some Card components). With Tailwind
you should apply the same principle and not fall into the trap of applying the same utility classes over and over again.
No matter if you use just Tailwind without anything else, Tailwind with React or Tailwind with CSS-in-JS. For example
you can use the `@apply` function provided by Tailwind or if you use React you can easily split it out into your own
component. Or define your CSS-in-JS object that you can re-use where you need it. With **twin.macro** this could look
like this:

```js
import tw from 'twin.macro';

const Grid = tw.div`
  relative py-8 grid grid grid-rows-2 md:grid-rows-none md:grid-flow-col gap-6 items-center justify-items-center
`;
```

And one very important thing at the end: even when using Taildwind all over the place you shouldn't forget about the
underlying CSS! Especially when you're just started with web development you should still learn all the CSS basics (and
a little beyond) and not make the mistake of forgetting all about it and just rely on Tailwind. For example when it
comes to debugging you should know where the styling comes from and what it means. So treat Tailwind as what it is, a
framework. It is a powerful tool to rapidly build your website or application but you should also know how it works
without it.
