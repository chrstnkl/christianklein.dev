There are a lot of discussions about estimations out there and different standpoints on what and how to estimate, or to
estimate at all. Since I recently had, again, a discussion about estimates I wanted to take this opportunity to share my
two cents.

Treat estimations as what they are: an estimation. They're neither a timebox nor a deadline, even though stakeholders
would prefer it that way. But in reality it's just the time you or your team estimate for a task. Who are you to
precisely predict the time on the hour you need on a task If you’re taking longer in the end, thats ok\*. For the next
task you might be done earlier then expected and so everything balances out again.

But ultimately, you shouldn't estimate in hours or working days but rather in abstract numbers like Fibonacci or even
animal sizes. 🐭🐘 Or you don't estimate at all. In previous teams we spend so much time on estimating our stories - and
in the end the estimations didn't work out. In cases like these, as long as you in your team have a common understanding
about the tasks, you should try to define the stories as small as possible and get the work done. In other cases,
estimates might be exactly the thing your team needs. That's also fine.

(_\* of course that doesn’t mean you should take as much time as you like. But that’s where trust comes in, you should
trust the people in your team and they should trust you. Otherwise you have bigger problems than thinking about
estimations._)
