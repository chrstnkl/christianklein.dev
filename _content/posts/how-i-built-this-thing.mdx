After a very long time without me having a personal web site out there, I decieded it is time to built one again. So
here we go, welcome! In this (first) post I wanted to outline why I built it and, probably more interesting for you (if
interesting at all), how.

## Tech stack

First, let's talk about the tech stack. Being involved in React development for the recent years, the question wasn't
React or no React, it was: Gatsby vs. Next.js. I have worked with both of them before (only for smaller projects, but
still) I have the impression that Next.js currently has a higher momentum and feels more powerful than Gatsby. You could
argue that a site like this would be the _perfect_ use case for Gatsby and I agree, but since the whole porpuse of
building this site was to have fun bulding it, fiddling around and thinking of it as my own little playground, I chose
Next.js.

Also I finally wanted to get some handson work with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), which is a utility-first
CSS framework. I was struggling with the decision to go for it a bit because I'm also a huge fan of `styled-components`.
So chosing a utility-first framework in favor of a powerful CSS-in-JS library? I was a bit reluctant until I stumbled
across [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) in a post of the creator of `styled-components`
([Why I Love Tailwind](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tailwind/)). Twin combines the capabilities of Tailwind with the
flexibility of CSS-in-JS and you can even combine it with libraries such as `styled-components` (but also for example
`emotion`). After that it was settled!
