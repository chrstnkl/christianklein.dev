There are a lot of discussions about estimations out there and different standpoints on what and how to estimate, or to
estimate at all. Since I recently had a discussion about estimations with a colleague I wanted to take this opportunity
to share my two cents.

Treat estimations as what they are: an estimation. They're neither a timebox nor a deadline, even though stakeholders
would prefer it that way. But in reality it's just the time and effort you or your team estimate for a task. Who are you
to precisely predict the time on the hour you need on a task. If you‚Äôre taking longer in the end, thats ok\*. For the
next task you might be done earlier then expected and so everything balances out again.

But ultimately, you shouldn't estimate in hours or working days and you also shouldn't make te mistake of trying to
translate your estimatoon to a time measurement. Estimate in abstract numbers like Fibonacci or even animal sizes üê≠üêò.
Or you don't estimate at all. In previous teams we spend so much time on estimating our stories - and in the end the
estimations didn't work out. In cases like these, as long as you in your team have a common understanding about the
tasks, you should try to define the stories as small as possible and get the work done. In other cases, estimates might
be exactly the thing your team needs. That's also fine.

(_\* of course that doesn‚Äôt mean you should take as much time as you like. But that‚Äôs where trust comes in, you should
trust the people in your team and they should trust you. Otherwise you have bigger problems than thinking about
estimations._)
